# EdThrive Reporting
This repository contains the process of replicating the acquisition and transformation of raw data from EdThrive database to produce data suited for Analytical processing and reporting. 

To check the process, please go to the jupyter notebook called [Calculations.ipynb](https://github.com/majoloso97/EdThrive-reporting/blob/main/Calculations.ipynb). The notebook [Exploring.ipynb](https://github.com/majoloso97/EdThrive-reporting/blob/main/Exploring.ipynb) is a compilation of trial and error operations made during the algorithm exploration. Is kept in the repository for future reference.

[A google sheets file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1twaOUnhvsruP_Ic27eBYkGqyGlkGOx0-r7uGv8gelTU/edit?usp=sharing) was created with examples of how to plot the gathered data.
